---

## **3. Advanced-Level Tasks (20 Tasks)**  
Focus on roles, handlers, vaults, and complex workflows.

### **Tasks**:Here’s the code and explanations for each of the tasks you mentioned. Each task is written as a separate Ansible playbook or role.

---

### **31. Create an Ansible Role to Set Up a Web Server**
1. **Create the Role Structure**:
   ```bash
   ansible-galaxy init webserver
   ```
   This creates a directory structure like:
   ```
   webserver/
   ├── tasks
   │   └── main.yml
   ├── handlers
   │   └── main.yml
   ├── templates
   ├── files
   ├── vars
   │   └── main.yml
   ├── defaults
   │   └── main.yml
   └── meta
       └── main.yml
   ```

2. **Define Tasks** (`webserver/tasks/main.yml`):

### (`webserver/templates/nginx.conf.j2`)

```
worker_processes auto;
events {
    worker_connections 1024;
}
http {
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name localhost;

        location / {
            root /usr/share/nginx/html;
            index index.html;
        }
    }
}

```

   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Install nginx on debian bases system
     apt:
       name: nginx
       state: present
     when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"
   - name: Install nginx on RHEL bases system
     yum:
        name: nginx
        state: absent
     when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"


   - name: Copy nginx configuration
     template:
       src: nginx.conf.j2
       dest: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
     notify: Restart nginx
   ```

3. **Define Handlers** (`webserver/handlers/main.yml`):
   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Restart nginx
     service:
       name: nginx
       state: restarted
   ```

4. **Use the Role in a Playbook**:
   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Set up a web server
     hosts: all
     become: yes
     roles:
       - webserver
   ```
 5. ** Run the playbook **
   ```
   ansible-playbook site.yml

```
---

### **32. Use Handlers to Restart a Service Only When Notified**
```yaml
---
- name: Restart a service when notified
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Copy configuration file
      copy:
        src: /path/to/config.conf
        dest: /etc/service/config.conf
      notify: Restart service

  handlers:
    - name: Restart service
      service:
        name: my_service
        state: restarted
```

---

### **33. Encrypt Sensitive Data Using Ansible Vault**
1. **Create an Encrypted File**:
   ```bash
   ansible-vault create secrets.yml
   ```
   Add sensitive data:
   ```yaml
   db_password: mysecretpassword
   ```

2. **Use the Encrypted File in a Playbook**:
   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Use encrypted data
     hosts: all
     vars_files:
       - secrets.yml
     tasks:
       - name: Print secret
         debug:
           msg: "Database password is {{ db_password }}"
   ```




3. **Run the Playbook**:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook playbook.yml --ask-vault-pass
   ```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8ec11fc-a281-4da1-a5fe-bfddf05fc876)

  tasks:
    - name: Install nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
      tags: install

    - name: Start nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
      tags: start
```

Run tasks with a specific tag:
```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --tags install
```

---

### **35. Deploy a Multi-Tier Application**
```yaml
---

          apt:
            name: nginx
            state: present

        - name: Start nginx
          service:
            name: nginx
            state: started

        state: started
        enabled: yes
```

---

### **38. Use the `include_tasks` Module to Modularize Your Playbook**
1. **Create a Task File** (`tasks/install_nginx.yml`):
   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Install nginx
     apt:
       name: nginx
       state: present
   ```

2. **Include the Task in a Playbook**:
   ```yaml
