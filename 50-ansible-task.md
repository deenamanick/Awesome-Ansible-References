Mastering Ansible by solving **50 Ansible playbook tasks** is an excellent way to gain hands-on experience and deepen your understanding of Ansible's capabilities. Below is a structured roadmap to help you tackle these tasks, along with examples and key concepts to focus on.

  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install nginx on Debian-based systems
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"

    - name: Install nginx on RHEL-based systems
      yum:
        name: nginx
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
```

---

### **2. Start and enable the `nginx` service**
```yaml
---
- name: Start and enable nginx

---

### **8. Run a shell command (`uptime`)**
```yaml

      debug:
        msg: "{{ uptime_output.stdout }}"
```

---

### **9. Fetch system information (`ansible_facts`)**
```yaml
---
- name: Fetch system information
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Get system information
      setup:

    - name: Show system information
      debug:
        var: ansible_facts
```

---

### **10. Use the `debug` module to print variables**
```yaml
---
- name: Debug example
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Set a variable
      set_fact:
        my_var: "Hello, Ansible!"

    - name: Print the variable
      debug:
        msg: "{{ my_var }}"
```

## **Key Concepts to Master**:
1. **Playbook Structure**: Learn how to write clean and organized playbooks.
2. **Modules**: Understand commonly used modules like `yum`, `apt`, `copy`, `template`, and `service`.
3. **Variables**: Use variables to make playbooks dynamic and reusable.
4. **Loops and Conditionals**: Automate repetitive tasks and handle different scenarios.
5. **Roles**: Organize playbooks into reusable roles.
6. **Handlers**: Trigger tasks only when notified (e.g., restarting a service).
7. **Ansible Vault**: Encrypt sensitive data like passwords and keys.
8. **Error Handling**: Use `block`, `rescue`, and `always` to handle errors.
9. **Idempotency**: Ensure playbooks can be run multiple times without causing issues.
10. **Collections**: Use community and custom collections to extend Ansible's functionality.

---

## **Tips for Success**:
- **Practice Regularly**: Solve at least 1-2 tasks daily to build momentum.
- **Use Documentation**: Refer to the [Ansible Documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/) for module details and examples.
- **Experiment**: Try modifying tasks to explore different approaches.
- **Join Communities**: Engage with the Ansible community on forums like Reddit, Stack Overflow, or the Ansible mailing list.
- **Automate Real-World Scenarios**: Apply your skills to automate tasks in your own environment.

By completing these **50 tasks**, you'll gain a deep understanding of Ansible and be able to automate complex infrastructure workflows with confidence. Happy automating! ðŸš€
